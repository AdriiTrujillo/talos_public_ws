Initialization of joint configurations
======================================

This package provides some low-level utilities for initialization of joint
configurations. `utils` subdirectory contains several preformed messages
`<subtree>.msg` which can be directly sent to the controller of the
corresponding subtree. These messages can be edited manually as needed for
specific cases. The messages can be sent in three ways:

1. Using `rostopic` from the command line.

2. Using Makefile in `utils` subfolder: type `make <subtree>` to send commands
to a subtree, or `make arms`, `make legs`, `make all`.

3. Using `send_joint_commands.launch` launch script, which requires `subtree`
argument to be set to a certain <subtree>, or any of 'arms', 'legs', 'all'.
